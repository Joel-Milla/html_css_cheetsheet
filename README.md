# Documentation for HTML tags and CSS properties
This repository hosts a static website that was created to contain relevant information for me to learn and practice HTML and CSS. The website contains important tags and properties that I considered useful when creating my own personal projects.

## Features
- Contains my own notes and tags that I consider important about HTML in the form of tables with a small description of each tag.
- Contains my own notes of the properties I use the most coupled with a small description in the form of tables. It also includes my notes on making a website responsive.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
