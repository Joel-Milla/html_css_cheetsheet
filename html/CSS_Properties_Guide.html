                <h2>General Notes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Inline element</b> don't have line break, respect margin and padding horizontally but not vertically, can't have width and height set. <b>Block elements</b> create line break, respect margin and padding both dimensions, can have width and height set. <b>Inline-block</b> don't create line break, respect margin and padding both dimensions, can have width and height set. Converting an elemnent to display:flex/inline-flex causes element to behave similar to block/inline-block elements.</li>
                    <li>Block elements like div, ul, li take as much width possible for parent element but not height. Setting element as flex or grid, allows to set explicitely width and height of block child elements.</li>
                    <li>Flex direction of row makes the child elements to stretch to fill the height and with column to fill the elements width.</li>
                    <li>Avoid using ul elements inside ul elements and div elements being exact children of ul elements.</li>
                    <li>The correct order for anchor elements to cascade properly is ":link", ":visited", ":hover", and ":active".</li>
                    <li>Height and width percentages are proportional to the heigh and width of the parent container. If want to use percentages for margin/padding, this will depend only on the <em>width</em> of the parent container. Also, for both cases, the width/height of the parent must be set first, if not weird things will happen.</li>
                    <li>Important to use media queries to consider the different <a href="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-5/screen-sizes.png?_gl=1*1b3fyly*_ga*NDEwOTU1MTc5NS4xNjk1NzM3NDg3*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY5NzU4NzIwMi41Mi4xLjE2OTc1ODkxNDMuNjAuMC4w" target="_blank">sizes</a> that exist between devices. Should first look at the breakpoints of the site (by resizing the webiste and searching where it stops to look good). A normal breakpoint is the 'max-width=480px' which is the normal size of a phone.</li>
                    <li>A media consists of "@media only screen and (media feature)". 'only screen' details that styles will only apply to screens, this value can also be printers, among others. Then the features are the conditions that decide if the CSS should be applied, and they are separated by and 'and' or a ','(comma) that represents an 'or'.</li>
                    <li>There are two scenarios that will need to scale image proportionally. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>First case is when you have an image inside the container in the html, to scale it you need to: <a href="../assets/images/scaling images.png" target="_blank">solution</a>.
                            Here the overflow avoids the image to be displayed outside the container. The max-width makes image span the entire container and auto height to keep the image consistent and display:block to be on their own and not together with other elements (inline-block, the default state)
                            </li>
                            <li>Second scenario is to add a background image to an element, to scale it you need to: <a href="../assets/images/scaling background images.png" target="_blank">solution</a>.
                            Here if the container is too big the image will not repeat itself (by default images repeat). It will also be always centered. The cover will make the image cover the entire element while keeping the proportions, and it will hide the image if it overflows.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Fonts Notes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can use BEM classing name methodology to name the classes. Can be block__element -> main__heading. Can use also block--modification (to target elements that will be modified) -> button--disabled</li>
                    <li>The font-size/family should be applied to the html element.</li>
                    <li>font-display: swap -> displays a text in a system font until the custom font is available. Correct way of declaring a font is in <a href="../assets/images/font-family-declaration.png" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
